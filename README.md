# Summary

A MERN Stack Application with an Ethereum test-chain storage option (for DApp conversion)

# Demo Notes

The test backend server uses node modules from the main React App. Be sure to install all the modules needed before running the app.

The ethereum testnet connection (made in the test server) requires an account on the Rinkeby test network and an infura intermediatary to communicate between the test server and the Rinkeby network. The private key passphrase can be obtained from your Rinkeby account and the infura API can be obtained from infura.com.
